# githubrator
Neck massager which uses Github contributions as vibration pattern.

## Purpose

When you are working as a developer, your significant other might have a stiff neck. This is because you are not massaging your partner's neck enough. This project is to solve this problem. When your are working harder and contributing to Github you wont have time to massage your partner's neck. And when you don't contribute to Github, you will have time to massage your partner's neck. This project will help you to maintain the balance between your Github contributions and your partner's neck massage.

## How it works

This project uses Github API to get your contributions. And it uses a vibration motor to massage your partner's neck. The vibration pattern is based on your Github contributions. The more you contribute to Github, the more your partner's neck will be massaged.

## Future improvements

- [ ] Instead of parsing svg, use the graphQL API to get the contributions. It was my first approach but I couldn't figure out why the query which was working well on explorer didn't work on my code. I will try again later.
- [ ] Add a button to start/stop the vibration.
- [ ] Ability to search and pick your favourite contributors.
